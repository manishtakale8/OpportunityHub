## 📌 Project Overview

**OpportunityHub** is a full-stack web application that helps students discover, track, and apply for relevant opportunities including internships, hackathons, competitions, scholarships, courses, certifications, and workshops — all in one place.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Students miss valuable opportunities because:
- Information is scattered across dozens of websites and platforms
- No personalization — everyone sees the same generic list
- Deadlines are hard to track across multiple sources
- No way to filter by skills or interests

---

## ✅ Solution

OpportunityHub provides:
- **Centralized opportunity discovery** across 7 categories
- **Personalized match scores** (rule-based, transparent, not ML)
- **Smart search and filters** (category, mode, location, skills)
- **Deadline tracking** from bookmarked opportunities
- **Student profiles** with skills, interests, and preferred categories

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Authentication | JWT-based register/login with bcrypt password hashing |
| Student Profile | Education, skills, interests, preferred categories |
| Explore | Search + filter by category, mode, location, skills |
| Match Score | Transparent rule-based 0–100 score per opportunity |
| Bookmarks | Save and manage favorite opportunities |
| Deadlines | Track upcoming deadlines from bookmarked opportunities |

## 🗄️ Database Models

### User
```
name, email, password (hashed), role (student|admin)
```

### StudentProfile
```

graduationYear, location, skills[], interests[], preferredCategories[]
```

### Opportunity
```
title, organization, description, category, skills[], interests[],
eligibility, location, mode, deadline, applicationUrl,
isActive, isSampleData, createdBy

## 🎯 Recommendation Algorithm

**Transparent rule-based system (no ML)**

| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Skills Match | 40% |
| Interests Match | 30% |
| Category Match | 20% |
| Eligibility | 10% |

Score range: 0–100. Each match reason is shown to the user.

Example output:
```
87% Match
✓ 3 matching skills
✓ Interest matched
✓ Preferred category matched
```
